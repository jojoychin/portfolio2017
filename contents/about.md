Currently, I work as an interaction designer and product engineer for the Verizon Open Innovation Concept Studio, creating completely new product concepts that bolster the core business. With a team of other Parsons alums, I’m also launching <a href="/postfromthepast">Post from the Past</a> - a company that delivers an immersive in-home experience uncovering the untold personal stories of historical figures.

<!-- In previous work as an interaction designer and product engineer for Verizon's Open Innovation Concept Studio, I developed the next generation of <a href="/jojo">artificial intelligence/chatbot systems</a>. -->

Previously, I did a brief stint at the <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/operations/index.page" target="_blank">NYC Mayor’s Office of Operations</a>, helping lay the groundwork for more strategic use of <a href="/03-nycmayorsoffice">data visualization</a> and design in order to better engage internal and community stakeholders. I’ve also done UX design and research for product development sponsored by Publicis Groupe, Red Bull, and Vonage and worked on diverse projects from a <a href="/01-dbot">chauvanistic chatbot</a> to a <a href="02-banalchaos">subway soundscape</a>.

Before becoming a full-time designer, I worked for over four years as a project manager and content strategist for <a href="http://www.animatingdemocracy.org/">Animating Democracy</a>, a national program of <a href="http://www.americansforthearts.org/">Americans for the Arts</a> that seeks to empower the use of creative practice for social change and civic engagement.

I hold an MFA in Design & Technology from Parsons School of Design and a BA in International Relations and a minor in Studio Art from Stanford University.
