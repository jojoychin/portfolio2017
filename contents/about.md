Currently, I work as an interaction designer for <a href="http://gallagherdesign.com/">Gallagher & Associates</a>, shaping multi-platform, physical and digital experiences and products for museum exhibitions and corporate spaces. I get excited about helping amazing, rich stories and content come to life and solving the unique challenges of designing for the latest technology-enabled experiences.

With a team of other Parsons alums, I’m also launching <a href="articles/01-postfromthepast">Post from the Past</a> - a company that delivers an immersive in-home experience uncovering the untold personal stories of historical figures. In previous work as an interaction designer and product engineer for Verizon's Open Innovation Concept Studio, I developed completely new product concepts that bolstered Verizon's core business.

While in graduate school, I did a brief stint at the NYC Mayor’s Office of Operations, helping lay the groundwork for more strategic use of <a href="articles/04-nycmayorsoffice">data visualization</a> and design in order to better engage internal and community stakeholders. I’ve also done UX design and research for product development sponsored by Publicis Groupe, Red Bull, and Vonage and worked on diverse projects from a <a href="articles/07-dbot">chauvanistic chatbot</a> to a <a href="articles/05-banalchaos">subway soundscape</a>.

In my past life, I worked for over four years as a project manager and content strategist for Animating Democracy, a national program of Americans for the Arts that seeks to empower the use of creative practice for social change and civic engagement.

I hold an MFA in Design & Technology from Parsons School of Design and a BA in International Relations and a minor in Studio Art from Stanford University.
