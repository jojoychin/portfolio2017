Currently, I work as an interaction designer for <a href="http://gallagherdesign.com/" target="_blank">Gallagher & Associates</a>, shaping multi-platform, physical and digital experiences and products for museum exhibitions and corporate spaces. I get excited about helping the amazing, rich stories and content come to life and solving the unique challenges of designing for the latest technology-enabled experiences.

With a team of other Parsons alums, I’m also (slowly) launching <a href="articles/01-postfromthepast">Post from the Past</a> - a company that delivers an immersive in-home experience uncovering the untold personal stories of historical figures.

In previous work as an interaction designer and product engineer for Verizon's Open Innovation Concept Studio, I developed completely new product concepts that bolstered Verizon's core business. I’ve also done <a href="articles/04-nycmayorsoffice">data visualization</a> and design work for the NYC Mayor's Office of Operations, as well as UX design and research for product development sponsored by Publicis Groupe, Red Bull, and Vonage.

My deep love of content and belief in the necessity of creative change comes from working for over four years as a project manager and content strategist for Animating Democracy, a national program of Americans for the Arts that seeks to empower the use of creative practice for social change and civic engagement.

I hold an MFA in Design & Technology from Parsons School of Design and a BA in International Relations and a minor in Studio Art from Stanford University.
